//This project analyzes carbon emissions data from various industries to identify trends and insights.
//Kaggle Carbon Emissions Dataset

SELECT industry, SUM(emissions) AS total_emissions
FROM carbon_emissions
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY total_emissions DESC;

//Results: The analysis revealed that the manufacturing industry has the highest carbon emissions, followed by transportation.
