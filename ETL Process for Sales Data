//Description: Developed an ETL pipeline to extract sales data from multiple sources, transform it, and load it into a data warehouse.
//Data Source: Sales data from CSV files and an online API.

//-- Extract
COPY sales_data FROM 's3://bucket/sales.csv' CSV;

//-- Transform
UPDATE sales_data
SET total_price = quantity * unit_price;

//-- Load
INSERT INTO data_warehouse.sales (SELECT * FROM sales_data);


//Results: The ETL process streamlined data integration and improved data accuracy.
